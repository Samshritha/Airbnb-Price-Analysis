# Airbnb-Price-Analysis
This project explores Airbnb pricing patterns in London using real listing data. The aim is to understand which factors have the biggest impact on nightly price and to present findings in a clear and practical way. The analysis focuses on three main elements: neighborhood differences, superhost pricing, and host experience.
